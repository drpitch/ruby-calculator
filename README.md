# ruby-calculator

A simple arithmetic calculator I developed to learn Ruby programming.

The evaluation of the expression involves doing these three steps:
* Convert the input expression into tokens
* Convert the token stream to postfix notation (a.k.a Reverse Polish Notation)
* Evaluation of postfix expression

## Running the program

```
Usage: ruby main.rb [expression]

Example: ruby main.rb "(8 + 5) * 20 / 2 - 6"

```
